MetroPopup
==========

This plugin is to get a nice metro (windows8 style) pop-up instead of the default browser pop-up.

You can either use it as a confirm box or for an information pop-up.

In the example file you can find out how to implement it.

Working in:
- IE 7-8-9-10
- Firefox 13.0.1+
- Chrome 20.0+
- Safari 5.1.7+
- Opera 12+ (however, there seems to be a bug with the opacity)

Live demo: http://rjvandoesburg.com/demos/metro_popup/

I hope to add more usefull features to it in the future.
Got an idea?
